An effective theory is an approximate description of a physical system that captures information on relevant scales. To illustrate the idea, consider the problem of describing the motion of water on the surface of an ocean. One approach is to model the water as a fluid, and the surface of the water can be thought of through interacting waves. This is an accurate description of the water on large scales, and we call it a large-scale model.

    Alternative descriptions of the same object at different scales. Left: a large-scale model describes the motion of water as interacting waves. Right: a small-scale model describes the motion as emerging from the collective motion of individual molecules.
